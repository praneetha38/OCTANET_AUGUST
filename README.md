In my web development journey, I got to work on three interesting tasks that helped me learn and showcase my skills. Let's take a closer look at each task:

**Task 1: Landing Page**
For my first task, I had to create an attractive landing page. This was perfect for beginners like me. Armed with my knowledge of HTML and CSS, I designed a page that looked good and was easy to use. I focused on adding sections, arranging items neatly, and adding headers and footers. I also added my personal touch to make it unique.

I made sure everything looked perfect by paying attention to details like alignment, spacing, colors, and shapes. I learned how to prevent elements from overlapping using CSS, which made the page look even better.

**Task 2: Task List**
In the second task, I took on the role of a project manager for different website projects. My job was to organize tasks by setting deadlines, priorities, and labels. This made everything clear and organized. By ranking tasks based on how urgent they were or how important they were to the project, I managed to work more efficiently and tackle the important things first.

I even added a feature that let me track my progress in real-time. This helped me see my accomplishments and figure out where things might be slowing down. Adjusting my approach as needed, I kept on track and met my project goals.

**Task 3: Clone a Website**
For my final task, I got the fun challenge of making a copy of an existing website or its design. This meant studying the original site's layout, design elements, and features closely. My goal was to recreate it as closely as I could, which pushed my web development skills to the next level.

By completing these tasks, I gained practical experience and improved my skills in web development. Each task taught me something valuable and helped me grow in this exciting field.
